It has been proven to be highly useful in industries such as banking, insurance, telecom, retail, travel, healthcare, etc., and has shown a very positive impact on business decision-making.</p>
<p>The program is designed to provide in-depth knowledge of data-based decision-making using real case studies. The module based program would impart participants a sequential learning with a strong foundation of data analytic techniques followed by real applications across various domains.</p>

<p>Strategic management is no longer the prerogative of top management or corporate headquarter. Middle-level managers are playing a crucial role in the process of organizational decision making. Though they heavily contribute to the strategic decision-making process, which defines the path and the pace of the organization, many middle-level managers are not fully aware of the various tools and frameworks of strategic management. Thinking primarily at the operational level often binds organizations into silos of partitioned thought. A strategic perspective enables liberation from these silos and promotes the achievement of goals at the organization level. In recent years, there has been much discussion on organizational competencies and organizational resources as the starting point of strategy. Hence, this program intends to explore the confluence of organization-level resources and competencies with industry-level opportunities and challenges associated with today’s rapidly evolving globalized world.</p>
<p>The program specifically aims to enable the participants:</p>
<p>• To understand the tools and frameworks in strategic management</p>
<p>• To analyze organizational resources and competencies</p>
<p>• To appreciate the difference between business-level and corporate-level strategies</p>
<p>• To explore the importance of strategic innovation and strategic transformation</p>
<p>• To understand the relevance of macro-level factors such as globalization or policy reforms for pursuing sustainable growth strategies</p>

<p>Marketing today has been turned into a battleground. Integrated marketing communication is the strategic weapon which fights competition and yields a ‘top-of-the-mind-recall’ to the brand. On one hand, consumers are becoming more and more demanding with lots of brands to choose from and on the other, their attention spans have significantly reduced due to clutter, chaos, and time poverty.</p>
<p>In a scenario like this, advertising and public relations are the ideal strategic weapons which, if used smartly, can earn mind space. However, with the advent of digital space and information access to the consumer, they can also backfire if not used properly. Therefore, organizations must aim at using these weapons strategically to generate positive returns on marketing investment.</p>
<p>Thus, one needs to get equipped with the latest concepts and techniques of advertising and get insights into strategies that attract eyeballs and capture the consumer’s mind. To help achieve the same, MICA offers an online Advanced Certificate in Advertising Management and Public Relations.</p>
<p>The course aims at skill and perspective building for junior and middle-level executives in the domain of Advertising Management. It seeks to deliver skills for managing advertising businesses, by combining theoretical learning in the field of communication with the right blend of management education.</p>

<p>Identifying and developing leadership that is aligned for challenges of the digital era is critical for most organizations today. With continuous change in the profile and priorities of the human capital over the years, the nature and style of leadership has no option but to adapt to ensure there is equal focus on revenue as well as employee satisfaction. The intense open market competition and technological revolutions, apart from putting a tremendous work pressure on the leaders and managers, has also created a requirement of conceptualizing and designing a new set of modern practices in practically every aspect of work place. In today’s context of people’s demographics, automated processes, a connected world and changed aspirations, the previous management literature, practices, tools and techniques need a complete revamp. There is a clear felt need of redefining the concept, and its practice to deal with the new set of challenges due to digitization and massive disruption arising out of it.</p>
<p>This course from IIM Lucknow is conceptualized to address this critical need of leaders and managers who are ready to take on the challenge of not only to make the organizations survive but to make it grow manifold. This course will offer insights into theories and application of leadership with an emphasis on learning knowledge, skills and values. The course intends to be participative with a lot of reflections/assessments into one’s own style of leadership. Thus, providing opportunities to identify specific areas of improvement.</p>
